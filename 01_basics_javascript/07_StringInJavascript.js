// lets learn some methods to concatinate strings
const greeting = "hello "
let userGreet = greeting+"Ranjit"; // This is the old version of string concatination lets learn new
console.log(userGreet)

let username = "Ranjit"
console.log(`Hello ${username} I hope you are doing well`); // here you can also use toupper case function as well

let myName = new String('Ranjit Vitthal Aiwale');
console.log(myName.charAt(5))
console.log(myName.toUpperCase)
